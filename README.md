# validate-fizop

Tools to validate a fizop (fiz Operator Package).

fizops were JSON files meant to store formulavize node style information such as background images and how to localize labels. This repository was intended to validate the JSON files against a pre-defined schema with attributes that mapped to [cytoscape styles](https://js.cytoscape.org/#style). To avoid tightly coupling this project with cytoscape, this approach has been abandoned in favour of the CSS-inspired style declaration features in fiz.
